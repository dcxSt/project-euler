PseudoCode Inner Right Triangles

for each perimeter p
for each possible value c

use formula to determine if ab is an integer
if it is then make a list of each pair of numbers give it when multiplied
look through all of these pairs and see how many of them satisfy the condition a+b+c=p

for each of these pairs add the [a,b,c] to the list of triangles and return this triangles

if this is the longest list of triangles that satisfy the property, then update the special one
